This program converts a gmail vCard address book into a format readable by abook
(http://abook.sourceforge.net).

To export your gmail contacts in vCard format, select Contacts -> Export and choose the 3rd export format (vCard).

The file will be saved by default as contacts.vcf

The input file (i.e. the vCard address book to import) can be specified with the -i parameter, and by default this is contacts.vcf.

The output file (i.e. the abook address book file to export) to can be specified with the -o parameter, and by default this is addressbook.

To obtain debug output, run the script with the -d parameter.
